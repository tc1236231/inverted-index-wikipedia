# Inverted Index Wikipedia

This is a project in parallel programming class to build an inverted index for wikipedia. I worked with another student to implement this Java program based on **Apache Hadoop** framework. We successfully built the inverted index using **Google Cloud Platform**. Please see my other repo for the corresponding visualization for this data.
